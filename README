Gearman status nginx module

To play with this module compile nginx with this ./configure option:
    
    --add-module=path/to/this/directory

Then activate it in nginx.conf. For instance for the URL /gearman-status:

  location /gearman-status {
    gearman_status on;
  }

Then after starting nginx you immediately can request the URL /gearman-status
and watch for the output of this module. This can be achieved for instance via:

  $ lynx -mime_header http://localhost/gearman-status

By default this module tries to connect to localhost:4730 in order to retrieve
Various information. There are also two directives which let you set the
hostname of the server running gearmand, and the gearmand port.

Directives Are "gearman_status_hostname", and "gearman_status_port".
